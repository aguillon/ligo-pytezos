# Ligo examples with PyTezos

This repository hosts a series of examples of [Ligo](https://ligolang.org/) contracts, written
either in the CameLIGO or JSLigo flavors, as well as tutorials in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Please note that this is a very early version. All suggestions and contributions are welcome.
